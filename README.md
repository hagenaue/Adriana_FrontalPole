# Adriana_FrontalPole
Data and analyses for Adriana's qPCR project examining gene expression in the frontal pole in relationship to Bipolar Disorder and Schizophrenia.

Note that for logistical reasons the raw qPCR files for each card are not included in this repository, but I have included the concatenated version of their results ("Concatenated_GabaGlu_wSubjectInfo.csv" , "Concatenated_DA5HT_wSubjectInfo.csv") produced by lines 333-986 in the code.
